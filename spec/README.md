# Engine spec assets

This folder contains **runtime-adjacent spec assets** used by `bdir-engine` for validation and testing.

Source of truth lives in the `bdir-spec` repository.

- Schemas: `spec/schemas/*.schema.json`
- Examples: `spec/examples/*`
- Fixtures: `spec/fixtures/validation/*`

When preparing a release, these files should be kept in sync with the matching paths in `bdir-spec`.
